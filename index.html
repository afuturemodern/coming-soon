    <main>Immerse yourself into the mysteries surrounding the events at Hightop Hotel. Each of the Five files gleam insights from a larger investigation. Within each ERC6551 case file is a 1of1 from a  collaborating artist as well as a section of prose exploring the world.

Winners of each auction will receive the 6551 and all its contents as well as be mailed the physical dossier, filled with prints of all collab pieces, a hand typed copy of each prose, and a handmade Hightop Hotel keycard NFC tag pairing the physical to its NFT counterpart.

The Auction begins September 26th at 5 P.M. EST. See you there.</main>
