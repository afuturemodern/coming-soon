        Immerse yourself into the mysteries surrounding the events at Hightop Hotel. <br /><br />
        Each of the Five Files gleam insights from a larger investigation. Within each ERC-6551 case file is a 1-of-1 from a collaborating artist as well as a section of prose exploring the world.
        </p>

      <p> 
        Winners of each auction will receive the 6551 and all its contents, as well as a physical dossier by mail, filled with prints of all collab pieces, a hand typed copy of each prose, and a handmade Hightop Hotel keycard NFC tag pairing the physical to its NFT counterpart.
        </p>

      <p>
        The Auction begins October 10th. See you there.
